# May-2020-FEWD-Tuesday

This guide will step you through some good basics to know for FEWD.

## Download locations for Recommended Software
- **[Visual Studio Code aka VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/):** 
    - Visual Studio Code is an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment. This basically means it is a fancy text editor meant to help you better work with files relating to programming.
    - The version for your OS should automatically display on the download button, but you can click the downward-pointing arrow next to the download button to select a different version if needed.
    - If you select a different version, make sure to select the link under the *Stable* column, and not the *Insider* column.
- **[NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/):** 
    - Select the version listed at the top on this page.
- **[Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/):** 
    - This is just for Windows Users. Mac OSX has *Terminal*, which can already handle Git commands.
    - Git for Windows provides you with a nice terminal for easier use of Git commands outside Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

For all of these downloads, just click Next until you can click Finish on the installs. Windows may pop up asking you to approve the install. They should display the program's icon and/or name. You can click *Yes* on these.

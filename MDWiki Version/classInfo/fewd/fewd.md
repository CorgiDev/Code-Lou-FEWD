# Front-End Web Development

## Introduction
Welcome to a Front-End Web Development wiki directed at helping Code Louisville students! To the right, you will see a menu with a list of links. There will be links for each week that we make a Wiki page for. I will try to get out a new page before class each week.

## Pre-Work Review
Before taking this course, your pre-requisite course work should have included:
- [Career Foundations](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/careers-foundations)
- [Introduction to HTML and CSS](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-html-and-css)
- [HTML Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/html-basics-2)
- [CSS Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics)
- [JavaScript Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-basics)

Don't hesitate to reference these sections from time to time when you need a refresher on a topic. Also remember that you can always reach out to your mentors or check out the channel associated with the night you are taking your course. Additionally, there is a #front-end-discussion channel and a #git-and-github channel.

## Syllabus
A link to the syllabus can be found in the **[Syllabus section](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Student-Resources/wiki/Code-Louisville-Basics)** of the Code Louisville [Student Resources wiki](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Student-Resources/wiki).

## Tech Event Requirements
Must attend a **minimum** of 2 tech events. Due to COVID, these events can be virtual. 
A link to submit a form after each event can be found in the class syllabus.

## Attendance Requirements
Class attendance every week is highly encouraged. 
- **3 or more** abscences will result in removal from the program.
- You may have the option to switch nights to avoid an abscence, but you need to clear this ahead of time to ensure your attendance is able to be properly recorded.
### Zoom Name
In Zoom, it is important that your name is set to something clear and recognizable. This is important for ensuring your attendance can be properly recorded, and it is important for if you join a Zoom meeting for professional reasons later on. It is recommended that you set it to your First and Last name.

## Project Requirements
Project requirements can be found on the **[Project Requirements](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Student-Resources/wiki/Project-Requirements)** page of the Code Louisville [Student Resources Wiki](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Student-Resources/wiki).

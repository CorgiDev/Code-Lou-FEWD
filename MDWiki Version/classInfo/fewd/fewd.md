# Front-End Web Development

## Introduction
Welcome to a Front-End Web Development wiki directed at helping Code Louisville students! To the right, you will see a menu with a list of links. There will be links for each week that we make a Wiki page for. I will try to get out a new page before class each week.

## Pre-Work Review
Before taking this course, your pre-requisite course work should have included:
- [Career Foundations](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/careers-foundations)
- [Introduction to HTML and CSS](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-html-and-css)
- [HTML Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/html-basics-2)
- [CSS Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics)
- [JavaScript Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-basics)

Don't hesitate to reference these sections from time to time when you need a refresher on a topic. Also remember that you can always reach out to your mentors or check out the channel associated with the night you are taking your course. Additionally, there is a #front-end-discussion channel and a #git-and-github channel.

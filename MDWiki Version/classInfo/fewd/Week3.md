## Responsive Web Design
The idea behind **Responsive Web Design** is that your website should be able to adjust layout for different device types / screen sizes so that those devices can view it clearly.
### Mobile First Approach
A **Mobile First Approach** means that you design your website for a mobile view first, and then use CSS (media queries in particular) to allow it to adjust to best first different screen sizes.
### Accessibility Aspect
Responsive web design is important for Accessibility as well to ensure people who may be limited to a particular size screen can still access content they may need.

## Using Web Developer Tools
The developer tools in your browser offer a powerful way to get a feel for how the code you put together functions once it is live. It can also be used to troubleshoot bugs that may be found in a live site. While the Treehouse videos will focus on the Developer Tools within Chrome, every browser should have a similar set of tools available that can be accessed. They may just have slightly different features and layouts.

### To open the Developer Tools
To open the developer tools you will need to:
- **Chrome**: Use the **F12** key on your keyboard, or press the following keys together: **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **i**
- **Internet Explorer (IE)**: Use the **F12** key on your keyboard

## What to expect after Week 8
After week 8, we will still meet for class, but the focus will be on working on projects and giving you the chance to ask mentors for assistance. If you have not installed the [Live Share extension for Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/), it is highly recommended as it can be an easy way to step through your code with someone else to get help.

**NOTE:** Make sure to get in your **2 networking events**. Submit events attended using the **[event form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRQFCnMVNdtqa8MmZK6u6qzVDfR80AiBdBQa2Q-nKh71qdeg/viewform?usp=sf_link)**. *1 event per form submission.*

## Project Requirements
Project requirements can be found in the **[Project Requirements](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Student-Resources/wiki/Project-Requirements)** section of the **[Code Louisville Student Resources Wiki](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Student-Resources/wiki/)**.

In the document you will notice a **Feature Requirements** section and an **Additional Requirements** section. Please remember that you **MUST** include at least 3 requirements from the **Feature Requirements**, but don't be afraid to include more.

You also **MUST** include **ALL** the requirements listed under the **Additional Requirements** section.

### Due Dates
Your project is due **by 12pm (Noon)** EST the last Friday of the class. Late submissions risk not being accepted.

**May 2020 Session**: This means 12pm (Noon) EST on Friday, July 31st, 2020.

## After graduation
After graduation, you will need to attend a **Job Readiness Workshop** in order to get added to the **Jobs** channel in the Code Louisville Slack *if you have not already*.

You should also strongly consider signing up for a 1-on-1 meeting with the Student Success Coordinator for help going over your resume and LinkedIn, help deciding how to approach your job hunt, and deciding your next learning steps.
